This repository contains various Solidity test cases I've made and found helpful.
Some of these may be out of date, etc, whatever.  No specific tests are included;
you'll have to figure out for yourself any particular tests you want to run with these.
Some of these have since been incorporated into Truffle's actual automated test cases.
All of this is copyright of Truffle.  Note: Not included is @gnidan's solidity-magic-square
test case, which I've gotten a lot of use out of.

Additional notes: While almost all these test cases take the form of Truffle projects,
some contain additional `broken` folders containing contracts that don't currently
compile, and `keccak-test` contains an additional `keccak.js` meant for testing how
Web3's `soliditySha3` function works.
